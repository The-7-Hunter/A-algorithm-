# A Star Algorithm


the idea of this project is to impelment A star Algorithm to find shortest path from University Gate to College of Computer, given a vertual map, distenation between each college along with possible routes, and finally the straight line from each node to College of Computer 

## Tools
  - HTML
  - P5 (Java Script)
  - CSS

for this project P5 is used which is a java script library that draws dynamic shapes and figures, here we are drawing 13 ellipses and thier lines representing connected buildings all to meet the provided shape (find it as AstarRequiredMAp.jpeg)

# Running the App!
You can find live demo of the app hosted on github pages at:
https://the-7-hunter.github.io/A-star-algorithm/index.html

an alternative way to run the app is by dwonloading or cloning the files 
then open the file index.html in your browser.

## Before you start
Distenation between each node is provided in (AstarRequiredMAp.jpeg) 
Straight line from each node to College of Computer:
- Gate 1500
- Hospital 1120
- Economics 1060
- Pharmacy 910
- Sciences 1250
- Engineering 1250
- Preparatory 1440
- Sharia 1140
- Arabic 1030
- Education 1500
- Medicine 930
- Conference 445
- Computer 0

## Required Files

- addons folder along with P5, P5.min.js, P5.pre-min.js are folders and files containing built in functions for P5.

- Astar.js contains the algorithm which will be excuted when button is clicked 

- sketch.js contains the actual functions for drawing shapes and lines
